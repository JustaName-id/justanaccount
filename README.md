# JustaNameAccount

## Overview

The `JustaNameAccount` is a Solidity smart contract designed to enhance Ethereum account functionalities by integrating support for EIP-7702 and EIP-4337. These integrations enable features such as transaction batching, gas fee sponsorship, and advanced signature validation...

## Features

- **Transaction Batching**: Allows the execution of multiple transactions in a single call, reducing overhead and improving efficiency.
- **Gas Sponsorship**: Supports mechanisms for third parties to sponsor gas fees, enabling users to interact with the Ethereum network without holding ETH.​
- **Signature Validation**: Implements the `isValidSignature` function in compliance with EIP-1271, facilitating contract-based signature verification.

## Key Components

- `execute` Function: Executes a single transaction to a target address with specified value and data. Ensures that the caller is authorized (either the eoa through 7702 or the designated entry point).
- `executeBatch` Function: Executes multiple transactions in a single call. If any transaction fails, the function reverts, indicating the index of the failed transaction.
- `entryPoint` Function: Returns the entry point contract associated with this account, as required by EIP-4337.
- `isValidSignature` Function: Validates signatures according to EIP-1271, enabling contract-based signature verification.​
- `supportsInterface` Function: Indicates support for various interfaces, including ERC165, IAccount, IERC1271, IERC1155Receiver, and IERC721Receiver.
